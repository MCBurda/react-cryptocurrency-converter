## React Cryptocurrenc Dashboard and Converter

Using HTML, Bootstrap 4, and React, I built a small web-app that allows users to track a dashboard of cryptocurrencies, convert money between currencies, and view a 30 day selected cryptocurrency pairs' conversion rate history. The project accesses several endpoint of the CryptoCompare Api (https://www.cryptocompare.com/), in order to display the data for the user. 

The app can be accessed via the following link: https://mcburda.github.io/react-cryptocurrency-converter/

## The following React libraries were used in its creation: 

- react-plotly.js/factory
- react-router-dom
- react-number-format
- react-async
